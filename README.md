# Jurgen Klopp Data Analysis
This is a project I am undertaking as a way of understanding Jurgen Klopp's manager history since his first appointment. I am a Liverpool fan so this is something that I am Passionate about. Word has it that Jurgen Klopp's 7th Year is usually when his team starts to deteriorate. I will be looking to investigate this as well. It's also a way for me to practice my newly acquired data analysis skills. Although the data contains Jurgen's time at Mainz, Dortmund and Liverpool, I will mainly be focusing on his time at Liverpool. I will be using the data to answer the following questions:

## Liverpool
