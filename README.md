# Jurgen Klopp Data Analysis
This is a project I am undertaking as a way of understanding Jurgen Klopp's manager history since his first appointment. I am a Liverpool fan so this is something that I am Passionate about. Word has it that Jurgen Klopp's 7th Year is usually when his team starts to deteriorate. I will be looking to investigate this as well. It's also a way for me to practice my newly acquired data analysis skills. Although the data contains Jurgen's time at Mainz, Dortmund and Liverpool, I will mainly be focusing on his time at Liverpool. I will be using the data to answer the following questions:

## Liverpool
## Questions I am trying to answer
1. What is the best formation for Liverpool in the Premier League?
2. What is the best starting 11 for Liverpool overall?
3. What is the best starting 11 for Liverpool in the UEFA Super Cup?
4. What is the best starting 11 for Liverpool in the UEFA Champions League?
5. What is the best starting 11 for Liverpool in the UEFA Europa League?
6. What is the best starting 11 for Liverpool in the FA Cup?
7. What is the best starting 11 for Liverpool in the League Cup?

A few things to note:
1. I will be using data scraped from transfermarkt.co.uk
2. The data is not complete. I will be using the data that I have to answer the questions.
3. The data I have is from when he started at Mainz in 2008 to his time in Liverpool on 10/10/2022.
4. This is a work in progress. I will be updating this as I go along.

## Other Questions
1. Jurgen Klopp's trend in each of the teams he has managed
2. Jurgen Klopp's trend in the Premier League
3.

## Data Analysis
According to the data, Liverpool have played a total of 391 matches under Jurgen Klopp.
176 of these matches were won by Liverpool, 82 were drawn and 133 were lost. 132 of these matches were won by Liverpool at home, and 22 matches were lost at home. 44 of these matches were won by Liverpool away from home, while a staggering 111 matches were lost. This depicts a very poor record for Liverpool away from home. 
Looking Further into the data we can Visualize how many matches Jurgen Klopp managed in each competition:
